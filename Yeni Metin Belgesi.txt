Seeking an early-career position



Currently improving increased 

As an energetic, ambitious and disciplined candidate who enjoys working with people from different cultures, I have been continuing my learning and working process on software development since the beginning of this year. Meanwhile I am on my compulsory legal internship and will complete it by the end of July. My aim is to leave a permanent mark in this sector, to create good chemistry with my colleagues and to produce very good results. In this regard, I will take the position you give me as a chance and be ready to produce the best results.
